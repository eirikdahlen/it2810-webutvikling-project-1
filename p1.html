            <h3>Galiartiso Galileiarto</h3>
            <p>
                Galiartiso Galileiarto (15 February 1564 â€“ 8 January 1642) was an Italian polymath, artist and painter.
                Galiartiso is a central figure in the transition from natural philosophy to modern science
                and in the transformation of the scientific Renaissance into a scientific
                revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                His greatest work "Universum Milka" has always been a mistery to many, it seems to have some
                sort of interactive elements that has amazed scientists for centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scientist also discovered an unique effect on the sun, and it is believed that Galileiarto
                discovered the future fate of the Sun before any other human, and showed it's doom in this picture.

                        <h3>CSS Grid vs Flexbox</h3>

                        <p>
                            CSS Grid
                            <br/>
                            CSS Grid is a tool for layout in webdesign. You can design your webpage using rows and columns
                            and define how big they will be according to other rows/columns and other objects. This gives us a 2D layout, instead
                            of 1D, which is the case with flexbox. It is used by defining rules to the main/parent element (a container of other elements)
                            and to its children elements/items.
                            CSS Grid is useful because you don't have to use floats and positioning, and thus avoid several problems.
                            I choose to use Grid for the most part in this project,
                            because I wanted to be able to do the layout in 2D, and I had some experience with Grid from earlier.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                            Flexbox
                        <br/>
                            Flexbox is also used for layout in webdesign. As with Grid, you specify a flex-container as a parent.
                            Then you can choose to order the items vertically or horisontally. Flexbox is on the other hand 1D, but it is possible to use it "as a"
                            Grid, by making a horisontal flexbox inside every vertical flexbox item.
                        </p>

                        <h3>SVG vs HTML Canvas</h3>
                        <p>
                            SVG
                            <br/>
                            Scalable Vector Graphics can be used to make vector elements in your webpage. This is done in the html where you define an svg-container
                            and then start adding elements like circles or rectangles. You can give every element an id, which makes it easy to access and write
                            functions for. You will have control of each element when you use SVG, and that's why I choose to use it in this project.
                            Unfortunately, it takes time to make many elements,
                            because you have to code every single one with x and y positions etc. It was also a lack of tutorials online for using jQuery to
                            do events and write functions for SVG. I used a plugin called GreenSock to do this, which made it really easy to change the behaviour to
                            the elements.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                            HTML Canvas
                        <br/>
                            HTML Canvas is like a container where you can generate new shapes and graphics fairly easy. Unlike SVG, you don't use html to write the code,
                            but JavaScript. You can then write some functions to make new shapes inside the canvas, change sizes, speed, colors etc.
                            No element in the canvas is "remebered" by the canvas, it creates them and then forget that they exist. To make changes to them,
                            you would have to save information about them in objects. I choose not to do this for this project, because I wanted control of the elements.
                            However, there is a lot more documentation on how to make cool things for canvas, so I will definately check it out next time.

                        <h3>jQuery</h3>
                        <p>
                            jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes JavaScript easier/simpler, and it is quite easy to learn.
                            It is very good for manipulation, events and animations. It is easy to access element in the html with jQuery, and that made it possible
                            for me to directly access the SVG elements I'd made, and do something with them. The syntax is fairly easy, you can write $ to access the jQuery
                            library. It is used in this way: $(selector).action, where selector is the element you do the action on. Actions can be css-changes, click, hover, hide,
                            fade, slide etc. A cool thing I did was to put all my planets in the same class in the html, then access them in the code.js, making a list with all planets.
                            Then I iterated through the list of planets and made changes to all of them at the same time in different ways.
                            I also used jQuery for button events in the Documentation tab.

                        <h3>Cross-browser testing</h3>
                        <p>
                            The purpose of cross-browser testing is to ensure that your web page work on many different web browsers or devices. This is important because
                            your web page will have different types of users, with different web browsers and devices. Some users may not have the newest updates, which can cause errors
                            because it doesn't support the latest CSS or JavaScript for instance. The user experience should be good on all devices.
                            By using cross-browser testing you can detect errors in the functions, design or layout. I used Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge to test my web page. I did
                            not experience any major differences while testing. I tried rezising the page, clicking the elements and look at the layout to test the app.

                            Before I started working with this project, I only had basic knowledge to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'd never used jQuery before so I had to do some
                            research for this. SVG was a little hard to find advanced tutorials for, so i watched some of the basic stuff and just tried it out on my own.
                            Mainly I used Youtube, StackOverflow and w3school for documentation and tutorials, because this would make it easier for me to see what the code did
                            instantly, instead of reading a book about it.
